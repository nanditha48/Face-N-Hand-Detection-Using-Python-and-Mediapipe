# Face-N-Hand-Detection-Using-Python-and-Mediapipe

### Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to utilize the Mediapipe library to detect facial landmarks and hand landmarks in real-time using the webcam feed.

### Understanding the Output:

- As you run the scripts, you'll see the webcam feed displayed on your screen.
- For face detection, you'll observe circles and lines indicating the detected facial landmarks.
- For hand detection, you'll see dots representing the detected hand landmarks.

### Customization and Further Development:

- You can customize the scripts to perform additional actions based on the detected landmarks. For example, you could track the movement of certain landmarks or trigger events based on specific gestures.
- You might want to experiment with different configurations or thresholds provided by the Mediapipe library to optimize detection for specific conditions.

### Example Use Cases:

- This project could serve as a foundation for applications like virtual makeup try-on, gesture-based controls, or even sign language recognition.

### Dependencies:

- This project relies on the `mediapipe` library, which is responsible for the actual detection and tracking of landmarks.
